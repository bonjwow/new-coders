## About The Project

In this research paper, I examine some of potential factors that may impact job interest of new coders (beginner programmers) in the technology field. I mainly focus on how educational background, such as the level of education and the field of study, plays a role in deciding what kind of job beginner programmers are looking for.

The original dataset used in this paper is the responses of the online survey run by `freeCodeCamp` in 2017 [Link](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/2017-new-coder-survey).
