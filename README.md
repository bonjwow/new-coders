## About The Project

In this research paper, I examine some of the factors that may impact job interest of new coders (beginner programmers) in the technology field. I mainly focus on how educational background, such as the level of education and the field of study, plays a role in deciding what kind of job beginner programmers are looking for.

The dataset used for this paper is the survey collected by `freeCodeCamp` in 2017 [Link](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/2017-new-coder-survey).
