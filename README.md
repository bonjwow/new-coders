## About The Project

In this research paper, I examine potential factors that may affect education costs of new coders to learn to code aside from their post secondary education, mainly focusing on the level of education, the size of city, commuting time, income, and learning time. A correlation matrix and linear regression models are used in this paper to identify if there is a correlation and causal relationship between the potential factors and the costs of learning to code.

The original dataset used in this paper is the responses of the online survey run by `freeCodeCamp` in 2017 [Link](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/2017-new-coder-survey).
